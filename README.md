# PyBer_Analysis
1. Overview of the Analysis
# The goal of this challenge is to provide ridesharing data for PyBer in order to promote access to ride-sharing services and affordability in underprivileged neighborhoods.

# The study is based on data from a CSV file in PyBer. Pandas was to produce a dataframe of the summary. We also used a chart generated using the information from the dataframe to see the data.

2. Results

# Figure 1 illustrates that the amount of money made by the service is pretty consistent from January to May. Urban cities have the most revenue, then surburban and lastly, rural cities. Between urban and surburban cities, the average connection is 2:1. Between urban and rural cities, the average is 9:1.

# This is an expected outcome as cities have more people and things to do compared to rural and surburban communities.

## Figure 2 shows us that there is a gap in the number of total rides in urban cities compared to surburban and rural cities. It also shows that there are a significant amount more of drivers in urban cities than surburban and rural ones. 

Rural drivers make much more than Suburban and Urban drivers according to the Average Fare per Driver.

# Conclusions
## 1.Riders in urban cities pay less per ride and drivers earn less per ride.
## 2. Urban cities generate the most income in relationship with Suburban and Rural communities.
## 3. There are less drivers in Rural communities, and their rideshares are more expensive because of this.

3. Summary

# Based on these results, there are three business recommendations to the CEO:
## 1. Since there are less drivers and the fare is higher in Rural cities, see what can be done to hire more drivers in these areas. It might be necessary to see if there is enough demand in the market to hire more drivers. 
## 2. Look at the data from the span of a year as opposed to January through May to see if there are any other trends that may have been missed. The time of year could be a factor.
## 3. Increase drivers in Suburban cities. This should also be tested first as well to see if there is a demand in the market for this.
